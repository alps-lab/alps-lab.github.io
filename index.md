## About Me

I am Associate Professor and Empire Innovation Scholar in the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University. I conduct research at the interface of machine learning, privacy, and security. I aim to develop safe and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Specifically, my recent work focuses on improving AI methods and systems along three major thrusts:

* Security Assurance -- resilient against malicious manipulations
* Privacy Preservation -- respectful for individual privacy
* Decision-Making Transparency -- interpretable to human perception

Before joining Stony Brook, I was Associate Professor in the College of IST at Penn State. I finished my Ph.D. at Georgia Tech and my undergrad study at Zhejiang University.
