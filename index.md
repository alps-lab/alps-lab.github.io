## About Me

I am Associate Professor and Empire Innovation Scholar in the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University. I conduct research at the intersection of machine learning, privacy and security, and aim to develop safe and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. My recent work focuses on improving AI along three major thrusts:

* Security Assurance -- resilient against malicious manipulations
* Privacy Preservation -- respectful for individual privacy
* Decision-Making Transparency -- interpretable to human perception

Before joining Stony Brook, I was Associate Professor in the College of IST at Penn State. I finished my Ph.D. at Georgia Tech and my undergrad study at Zhejiang University.
